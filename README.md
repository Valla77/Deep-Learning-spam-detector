# Spam detection project - AT&T Orange SPAM detector

This project has been presented as part of my **Machine Learning Engineer certificate** for the Jedha Data Fullstack program.
## Company

AT&T Inc. is an American multinational telecommunications holding company headquartered at Whitacre Tower in Downtown Dallas, Texas. It is the world's largest telecommunications company by revenue and the third largest provider of mobile telephone services in the U.S. As of 2022, AT&T was ranked 13th on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations, with revenues of $168.8 billion! ðŸ˜®

## Project

One of the main pain point that AT&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

## Goal

The objective is to create a spam detector capable of promptly identifying and flagging spam messages as they are received, solely relying on the content of the SMS.

## Deliverable

To accomplish this project, your need to:

Develop a notebook that conducts preprocessing and trains one or more deep learning models for predicting whether an SMS is spam or ham.
Clearly present the attained performance outcomes.
